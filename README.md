# HOI4 Parliament Diagram

A handy Python generator which will generate code for a dynamic parliament diagram which can be slotted into any Hearts of Iron IV Scripted GUI.

These diagrams can have an arbitrary number of seats and can use any set of icons. They are fairly lightweight and low-code, relying on three arrays and a dynamic list.
In addition, tooltips, rings to highlight coalition members, and more can be added without much additional effort.

This repo also includes a code sample to help you get started.

## Guides
